### Conclusion
- We have applied imprecise eBN to address the problem of performing risk assessment under entwined uncertainties arising (mostly) from climatic change projections 
  - for precise probability distribution
  - for imprecise probability distribution
  - we have applied imprecise eBN framework to the radioactive waste disposal case of study
    - concrete integrity is the main driver of the analysis
    - concrete integrity have been evaluated using the 2 corrosion models for carbonation-induced corrosion and chloride-induced corrosion 
    - results obtained are internally coherent showing how the precise failure probability value is always included in the failure probability interval.
- the usage of imprecise eBN allows for:
  - aggregate the results coming from different scenario in a framework that can questioned through exact-inference algorithm to perform both prognosis and diagnosis of the system
  - overcame epistemic uncertainties problem coming from limited or incomplete data, through imprecise probability
- eBN limitations:
  - case of study related:
    - models used to assess carbonation and chloride induced corrosions are simple  
  - computational related:
    - precise eBN evaluation of functional nodes rely on standard and advanced Monte Carlo simulations, that must be repeated for all the possible scenario. Whenever the model/s involved are external finite element model with elevated computational time, the computational effort for evaluating the nodes is a problem.
    - for imprecise eBN this problem is even more highlighted cause the implemented approach are Double Loop Monte Carlo and Random Slicing which still requires standard Monte Carlo simulation together with a global optimization procedure.

- Future works:
    - concrete degradation have been chosen as the driver for assessing the reliability of the disposal, both other macro-phenomena should be included and studied to obtain a more comprehensive risk assessment.
    - Presented eBN and imprecise eBN both have 2 final nodes for evaluating the risk, one for carbonation-induced corrosion and one for chloride-induced corrosion. The introduction of a node that unify this two effects in a not trivial should be considered:
      - trivial ways are, "or-gate" which potentially underestimate the combined effect of the two phenomena in the same spatial point. And "sum-of-effects" which always sum up the corrosion depths induced by carbonation and chloride, which overestimate the combined effect everytime they are taking place in different spatial points.
      - Therefore a better study regarding this two phenomena should be considered.
    - control nodes for reducing chloride boundary concentration and relative humidity have been introduced in a trivial way, without considering associated operative costs and optimization of their thresholds and targets, that's something that should be evaluated.
    - Approximate method for breaking the Double Loop introduced in the imprecise eBN should be considered to reduce the computational burden of the framework, such as CABO and NISS.
