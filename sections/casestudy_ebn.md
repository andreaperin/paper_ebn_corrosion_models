### eBN for concrete degradation
- selected framework to perform risk analysis for concrete degradation considering climate change is the eBN one.
- the two main models considered are the carbonation induced corrosion, presented in 3.2.1 and the chloride induced corrosion, presented in 3.2.2.
- climate change data regards 3 main projections, namely "ssp1", "ssp2" and "ssp5", for temperature, $CO_2$ concentration and relative humidity from 2020 to 2100.
#### Precise eBN
- the ebn for simulating the carbonation induced corrosion is the one presented in Fig.
