Radioactive waste disposal are engineered with concrete structures that must resist for very long times. 
Concrete structures are subject to chemical corrosion, which is significantly influenced by environmental exposure, a condition intensified by climate change.
We use Bayesian Networks to model the corrosion processes. 
To account for the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and the impacts of climate change we develop an enhanced Bayesian Network modelling framework leveraging continuous nodes and incorporating imprecise probabilities especially due to climate change projections. 
The modelling framework is applied to carbonation and chloride corrosion processes, considering the uncertainties associated with environmental parameters such as temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and relative humidity.
The results demonstrate the capabilities of the enhanced Bayesian Network modelling framework.
