Radioactive waste disposals are engineered with concrete structures that must resist for very long times. 
Concrete structures are subject to chemical corrosion, which is influenced by environmental exposure, a condition intensified by climate change.
We use Bayesian Networks to model the corrosion process and develop an enhanced Bayesian Network modelling framework leveraging continuous nodes and incorporating imprecise probabilities, to account for aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, especially due to climate change projections. 
The modelling framework is applied to carbonation and chloride corrosion processes of concrete structures in radioactive waste disposals, considering the uncertainties associated with environmental parameters such as temperature, carbon dioxide concentration and relative humidity.
The results demonstrate the capabilities of the enhanced Bayesian Network modelling framework proposed.
