The susceptibility of concrete structures to chemical corrosion is significantly influenced by environmental exposure, a condition intensified by climate change. 
Bayesian Network has demonstrated significant effectiveness in modeling the interdependencies in such corrosion processes. However, traditional Bayesian Networks face challenges in addressing aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties and in accommodating the impacts induced by climate change on corrosion dynamics. We propose an enhanced Bayesian Network framework that aims to effectively manage these uncertainties by leveraging continuous nodes and incorporating imprecise probabilities, especially from climate change projections. This framework is applied to carbonation and chloride corrosion phenomena, which are the main degradation mechanisms in concrete structures, considering the intertwined uncertainties associated with environmental parameters such as temperature, $CO_2$ concentration, and relative humidity over time. The results demonstrate the significant capabilities of the enhanced Bayesian Network framework, not only by improving structural safety analysis to disentangle from the remaining uncertainties but also by advancing the mitigation strategies for corrosion risks in concrete structures.
